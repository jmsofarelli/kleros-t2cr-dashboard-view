/**
 *  @title ArbitrableTokenList
 *  This contract is an arbitrable token curated registry for tokens, sometimes referred to as a TokenÂ² Curated Registry. Users can send requests to register or remove tokens from the registry, which can in turn, be challenged by parties that disagree with them.
 *  A crowdsourced insurance system allows parties to contribute to arbitration fees and win rewards if the side they backed ultimately wins a dispute.
 *  NOTE: This contract trusts that the Arbitrator is honest and will not reenter or modify its costs during a call. This contract is only to be used with an arbitrator returning appealPeriod and having non-zero fees. The governor contract (which will be a DAO) is also to be trusted.
